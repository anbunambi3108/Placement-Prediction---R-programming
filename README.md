# Placement-Prediction: R-programming

#### The Placement data gives us an insight into student details such as Age, Gender, Stream, no. of internships, CGPA, and if they stay in a hostel or not.

In this, a detailed Exploratory data analysis(EDA) on Student Placement Dataset with Visualization had done. Finally, a Machine Learning Model was created that predicts whether a particular candidate got placement or not based on various independent attributes like CGPA, No of internships, No of backlogs, etc.

### Features in the dataset:

Age: Age of the student

Gender: Male or Female student

Stream: The department they belong to

Internships: No of internships they have done

CGPA: The Cumulative Grade Point Average out of 10

Hostel: Hosteller or day scholar ( Yes/No response)

HistoryOfBackLogs: No of backlogs they have throughout their semesters

PlacedOrNot: Placement confirmed or not (Yes/No response) - Dependent variable
